# 3D Noise: A New Approach to Anonymous File Encryption and Sharing

## Overview
3D Noise is an innovative encryption method designed for anonymous file sharing and secure data distribution. The core concept involves splitting a file into three distinct layers (S_R, S_G, S_B), which are individually encrypted using XOR logic, hashing, and weights. Each layer alone is meaningless, appearing as random noise, but when combined, they reveal the original file.

## Features
- **Layered Encryption:** Files are divided into three layers representing different "colors."
- **Secure Sharing:** Only the combination of all three layers can decrypt the original file.
- **Anonymous Players:** Users, called "players," choose a layer (color) to share with others.
- **Hash-Based Security:** Uses global and stabilized hashes to ensure unique encryption for each layer.

## How It Works
### 1. Splitting the File
The input file is divided into three layers:
- **S_R:** Red layer
- **S_G:** Green layer
- **S_B:** Blue layer

### 2. Generating Hashes
- A global hash (H) is generated for encryption.
- A stabilized hash (H_s) for S_B is derived from H:  
 ```
  \[
  H_s[i, j] = \left(H[i, j] + H[n-i-1, j]\right) \mod 256
  \]
 ```

### 3. Encrypting Layers
Each layer is encrypted using XOR logic:
```markdown
\[
E_R[i, j] = S_R[i, j] \oplus H[i, j] \oplus S_G[i, j]
\]
\[
E_G[i, j] = S_G[i, j] \oplus H[i, j] \oplus S_B[i, j]
\]
\[
E_B[i, j] = S_B[i, j] \oplus H_s[i, j] \oplus S_R[i, j]
\]

```
### 4. Decrypting Layers
The original layers are reconstructed by reversing the encryption process:
```markdown
\[
S_R[i, j] = E_R[i, j] \oplus H[i, j] \oplus E_G[i, j]
\]
\[
S_G[i, j] = E_G[i, j] \oplus H[i, j] \oplus E_B[i, j]
\]
\[
S_B[i, j] = E_B[i, j] \oplus H_s[i, j] \oplus E_R[i, j]
\]
```

### 5. Reconstructing the File
All layers are combined to restore the original file.

## Use Cases
- **Anonymous File Sharing:** Share data securely without revealing content unless all layers are combined.
- **Decentralized Storage:** Distribute encrypted layers across multiple participants.
- **Secure Collaboration:** Enable teams to share partial data securely.
